# Claims-Reporting-Automation-System
A cloud‑native simulation of a real enterprise workflow: mainframe output → report generation (Excel/PDF) → cloud upload → dashboard for download. This project modernizes a legacy reporting pipeline using FastAPI, React, GCP Cloud Run, Cloud Storage, PostgreSQL, and Python automation — all built using mock data (fully safe and compliant).
